The agent uses last five days of memory to estimate the next days travel time. This memory is mode specific. In this model, agent has 4 memories [walk, bike, pt, car]. action update_mode_specific_memory (float tt, int mode) { //tt is morning_travel_time add tt to:self.mode_specific_memory[mode]; remove index:0 from:self.mode_specific_memory[mode]; } arguments travel time (float) : the travel time experienced in the recent trip mode (int) : the mode used by the agent in recent trip returns nothing : the function returns nothing, it just updates an existing variable. usage the following example updates memory of mode 1 = walk. do update_mode_specific_memory(travel_time, 1) "],

The attributes of this shapefile are imported and mapped into various model variables - as attributes of the building species. The main classification of buildings is based on its usage.
