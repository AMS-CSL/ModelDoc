This massive growth challenges the liveability of urban environments. Designing sustainable cities attractive to tourists, industry and commercial organizations as well as pleasant to live in, requires a thorough understanding of urban dynamics and the role of individual and collective human decision- making within this "],
["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Objective 1.2 Methods", " Chapter 1 Introduction Cities like other complex adaptive systems commonly develop in an open-ended and often unexpected way with neighborhoods and urban populations in constant development. These urban dynamics exhibit many wicked problems in which the issue at hand as well the potential solutions are strongly dependent on the perspectives of the multitude of stakeholders involved. Conflicting use-patterns among city users impact a multitude of urban quality indicators and result in specific spatial-temporal patterns and conflicts (Fig. 1). Currently, our understanding of these complex processes remains limited and even more so our capacity to anticipate these complex developments. 1.1 Objective Against this backgound the objective of the City Simulation Lab is: To develop a City Simulator toolbox including various agent-based models of urban systems To increase our current understanding of complex urban processes leading to specific spatial-temporal patterns through simulation of urban systems through the implementation of the agent-based simulation toolbox. To improve the capacity to anticipate complex urban dynamics through interactive participatory workshops developing and implementing a Participatory Urban Modelling (PUM) framework. 1.2 Methods 1.2.1 Case: Tourism expansion in Amsterdam Amsterdam has seen a steep 40% increase in tourists in just five years, with currently 17 million people visiting the city on annual basis. This strong increase impacts the liveability of the city and causes conflicts among different users of the city. 1.2.2 Participatory Urban Modelling (PUM) In order to include the different perspectives of local stakeholders, we developed a Participatory Urban Modelling (PUM) framework. Within this cyclic process researchers and stakeholders actively collaborate in the development of the City Simulator toolbox through a combination of (simulation) games (Fig.2). Through interactive gaming workshops, stakeholders collectively define potential policy changes and explore the impacts on quality indicators and spatial conflicts. “PUM” "],

The agent uses last five days of memory to estimate the next days travel time. This memory is mode specific. In this model, agent has 4 memories [walk, bike, pt, car]. action update_mode_specific_memory (float tt, int mode) { //tt is morning_travel_time add tt to:self.mode_specific_memory[mode]; remove index:0 from:self.mode_specific_memory[mode]; } arguments travel time (float) : the travel time experienced in the recent trip mode (int) : the mode used by the agent in recent trip returns nothing : the function returns nothing, it just updates an existing variable. usage the following example updates memory of mode 1 = walk. do update_mode_specific_memory(travel_time, 1) 4.2 evening_movement() This function makes the agent move from office to home in the evening. action evening_movement { float my_speed &lt;- mode_speed_int[self.value_mode_actual] ;// # m / # sec; do goto target: any_location_in(my_home) on: g speed: my_speed; if the_target = location { my_evening_home_arrive_time &lt;- current_date; } } arguments none returns nothing usage do evening_movement; 4.3 morning_movement() This function makes the agent move from office to home in the evening. action evening_movement { float my_speed &lt;- mode_speed_int[self.value_mode_actual] ;// # m / # sec; do goto target: any_location_in(my_home) on: g speed: my_speed; if the_target = location { my_evening_home_arrive_time &lt;- current_date; } } arguments none returns nothing usage do morning_movement; "],
